# First Game

This is a small 2D block-based adventure built with Godot. Players explore a procedurally generated world, collect resources and fight simple enemies. An inventory and quick slots system lets you manage items like blocks and tools while you explore.

## Controls

Below are the default input actions defined in `project.godot`:

- **attack**: `J` key or Left Mouse Button
- **move_left**: `A` key
- **move_right**: `D` key
- **jump**: `Space` key
- **open_inventory**: `I` key
- **use_item**: `E` key
- **place_block**: Right Mouse Button

These bindings can be adjusted in the Godot project settings under `Input Map`.

## Building

The project targets **Godot 4.4.1**. Open the repository with that version of the engine and run the game from the editor. To create a Windows executable, use the provided `export_presets.cfg` preset named **Windows Desktop**.
